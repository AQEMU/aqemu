###Latest news:
0.9.3 is on the way with many new features. But development has stalled for a while,
mostly due to life demanding my attention for other tasks.

I set up a [crowdfunding page for AQEMU](https://salt.bountysource.com/teams/aqemu), it will enable users to donate for the whole
project and/or for individual issues. Please consider setting up a monthly donation.

I want AQEMU to pick up steam again with your help, with the goal of making the best
virtual machine manager GUI.
